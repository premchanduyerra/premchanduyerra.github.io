            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience, specializing in React.js, Spring Boot, and microservices.
                My journey in technology started with a curiosity to understand how applications work, and over the years, I've honed 
                my skills to create seamless and scalable solutions. I've worked on projects ranging from government portals to 
                personalized diet plans, always aiming to improve user experience and system performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond work, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading self-help books, and exploring new technologies. My goal is to 
                contribute to impactful projects that solve real-world problems while continuously learning and growing as a developer.
